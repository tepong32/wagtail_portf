User Authentication screen will be inside a modal (django-bootstrap-modal-forms) that will be an overlay to the HomePage.
IF you wish to have a separate page showing only the specific html's content, you can use the 'extends home/index.html' tag and customize as needed.

Pages:
	login.html
	logout.html
	register.html
	password-reset.html
	password-change.html

	css & js pages
