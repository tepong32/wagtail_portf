User pages may or may not have their own navigation, depending on the needs of the website.
If a navigation separate from the Main Navigation is needed, create a separate "base.html" and "nav.html" inside this folder and "extend/include" as needed.

Pages:
	profile.html
	profile-edit.html
	profile-list.html	- (user list view for navbar search function)

	css & js pages
